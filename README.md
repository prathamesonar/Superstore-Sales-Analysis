# Superstore Sales Analysis with Snowflake and Looker Studio

## üöÄ Objective
This project analyzes the Superstore sales dataset to identify top-performing products, valuable customer segments, and key sales trends. The goal was to process a large dataset using a modern data stack and present actionable insights through an interactive dashboard.

## üíª Tech Stack
* **Data Cleaning:** Python (Pandas)
* **Data Warehouse:** Snowflake
* **Data Analysis:** SQL
* **Data Visualization:** Google Looker Studio

## üìà Key Findings

* **Top Products by Sales:** Technology products, specifically **Phones** and **Chairs**, are the most significant revenue drivers. This suggests that high-value items are the main contributors to sales, and marketing efforts could be focused on these categories.

* **Sales by Customer Segment:** The **Consumer** segment is the largest source of sales, followed closely by the **Corporate** segment. The **Home Office** segment, while still valuable, contributes the least. This indicates that both B2C and B2B strategies are critical to the business's success.

* **Sales by Shipping Mode:** **Standard Class** shipping is overwhelmingly the most popular option among customers, accounting for the vast majority of all orders. This highlights its importance in logistics and customer satisfaction.

* **Top States by Sales:** The dashboard clearly shows that **California** and **New York** are the two most critical states for the business, generating significantly more sales than any other region. Concentrating marketing and logistical resources in these areas could yield the highest returns.
